What do I need a symbol table for?

Provide a list of symbols in each function or struct.

A symbol should say when it is created.
Since variables cannot be created halfway through a line - SET is a statement only - this only needs to be a line number. We can pull this from the token when we create a variable.
This should be the SET statement.

PROCEDURE print TAKES STR a AS
	SET cout TO CALL open WITH "std::cout"
	CALL cout.write WITH a
END PROCEDURE

SET a TO 5
INPUT b ">> "
IF b < a DO
	SET a TO "Hello World"
ELSE DO
	SET a TO 5+16i
END IF

CALL print WITH a

python:
def print(a):
	assert isinstance(a, str)
