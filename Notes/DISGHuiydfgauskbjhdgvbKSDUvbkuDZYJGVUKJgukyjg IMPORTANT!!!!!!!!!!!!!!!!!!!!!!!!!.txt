The essay must go through what a transpiler is, what it is used for, why it is used, why I chose the languages that I did - source language, target language and creation language, why a transpiler was needed in this scenario. It must then explain each major stage of the process - i.e. lexer, parser, semantic analyser, optimiser, code generator - structure, major revisions to structure, perhaps even what each function does.
